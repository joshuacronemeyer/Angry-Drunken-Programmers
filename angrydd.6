.TH angrydd 6 "July 29th, 2004" SCOL "Angry, Drunken Dwarves Manual"
.SH NAME
angrydd \- a falling block puzzle game
.SH SYNOPSIS
angrydd [ \fB\-\-debug\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
In Angry, Drunken Dwarves, you are an angry, drunken dwarf. Why are you so
angry? Who knows. But you've decided to take your aggression out on other
dwarves, by dropping gems on their heads. Lots of gems.
.PP
You have your own supply of gems, which will slowly fall from
the top of the screen. As gems reach the bottom, they will land and sit in
place. If you put enough gems of the same color in a rectangle shape, they
will merge and form a crystal.
.PP
Less common are break gems, which are circular. When you drop a break gem
on a gem or crystal of the same color, it will destroy any gems of that
color adjacent to it. Crystals are worth much more than an equal number of
regular gems.
.PP
For more information, see the "How to Play" screen in the game.
