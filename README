Angry, Drunken Dwarves      http://www.sacredchao.net/~piman/angrydd/index.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Angry, Drunken Dwarves, you are an angry, drunken dwarf. Why are you so
angry? Who knows. But you've decided to take your aggression out on other
dwarves, by dropping gems on their heads. Lots of gems.

Installing
----------
On Unix:
 $ make check 		(optional)
 $ su
 Password: <enter it here>
 # make install

Then run 'angrydd'. Alternately, check the website to see if a
package is available for your system.

On Windows, simply unzipping the program and double-clicking 'angrydd.py'
or 'angrydd.exe' should run it, if you have Python and Pygame
installed. (Don't ask me for help getting it running on Windows.)

Playing
-------
Angry, Drunken Dwarves is much like many other falling block games, so
you can probably jump right in and play. The basic goal of the game is to
combine gems of the same color into large crystals, then break them,
dropping more gems on your opponent.

Although the game is much more fun with gamepads, it can be played with
the keyboard.

in the menu.

Character Selection
-------------------
When you play two player games, Angry, Drunken Dwarves will ask you to
pick a character to play. Besides the obvious importance of things like
beard length, each character also has a 6x4 "drop gem pattern". This is
the pattern by which gems are dropped onto an opponent's side. The more
irregular the pattern, the tougher it is to prepare for. However, if
the pattern is too random, your attack power will be lessened slightly.
The converse is also true: If your pattern is very regular, you will drop
more gems to compensate.

Secrets

There are hidden features in Angry, Drunken Dwarves! As you reach certain
milestones, new things will appear in your game menus. (You should be able
to find the first easily...)
