Larry Wall may not have a beard, but he has one hell of a moustache.  He is the author of Perl, the rn Usenet client and the nearly universally used patch program. He has won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest twice and was the recipient of the first Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1998. Try not to piss him off.
